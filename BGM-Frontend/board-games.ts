/*Here goes the logic for the table with board games.*/
/*This should be relatively simple. It fetches the data of the
Board Games from the database through the back-end, and orders it nicely.
So, most of what has to be done here is to check what data are given 
in the back-end (how are the arrays of the board games made), and give
them some shape!*/
